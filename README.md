# Coding Challenge (React)

> NASA provides a range of open APIs:
> https://api.nasa.gov/
>
> Use one (or more) of these to retrieve, display and browse images or data in a small demo project (in the range of about 2 to 4 hours).
>
> For instance, you may use the _Astronomy Picture of the Day_ (APOD) API to query pictures.
> You might want to present them in different way from the official web version:
> https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html.
>
> For instance, you might:
>
> - create a weekly overview (as opposed to showing one picture at a time),
> - create a grid or calendar view,
> - you could show the photos for a particular day of the year (e.g. somebody's birthday) for the last years,
> - …
>
> Or you use the _Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera_ (EPIC) API to show pictures of Earth:
> https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/api
>
> - maybe display the most recent image which includes for the user's current (geo-)location
> - animate an image sequence
> - allow users to zoom in
> - …
>
> Or you create a more convenient way of presenting and browsing _Mars Rover Photos_.
>
> Something like that. Pick any of these ideas or make up your own.
>
> Remember that we do not expect a polished or even complete solution.
> Your code is just a conversation starter.
>
> We do not expect you to spend more than 2 to 4 hours on this.
>
> We are looking forward to talking to you and hope you have fun working on the challenge.
