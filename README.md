# Coding Challenge (React)

> NASA provides a range of open APIs:
> https://api.nasa.gov/
>
> Use one (or more) of these to retrieve, display and browse images or data in a small demo project (in the range of about 2 to 4 hours).
>
> For instance, you may use the _Astronomy Picture of the Day_ (APOD) API to query pictures.
> You might want to present them in different way from the official web version:
> https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html.
>
> For instance, you might:
>
> - create a weekly overview (as opposed to showing one picture at a time),
> - create a grid or calendar view,
> - you could show the photos for a particular day of the year (e.g. somebody's birthday) for the last years,
> - …
>
> Or you use the _Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera_ (EPIC) API to show pictures of Earth:
> https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/api
>
> - maybe display the most recent image which includes for the user's current (geo-)location
> - animate an image sequence
> - allow users to zoom in
> - …
>
> Or you create a more convenient way of presenting and browsing _Mars Rover Photos_.
>
> Something like that. Pick any of these ideas or make up your own.
>
> Remember that we do not expect a polished or even complete solution.
> Your code is just a conversation starter.
>
> We do not expect you to spend more than 2 to 4 hours on this.
>
> We are looking forward to talking to you and hope you have fun working on the challenge.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
